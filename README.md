Helper module for developing and testing with Lightning

NEVER INSTALL THIS MODULE IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT. You should only deploy and install this module in development environments

This module takes care of a few common development and testing tasks for you:
* Enables developer-focused modules (Features UI, Rest UI, etc...)
* Creates user accounts for each user role on the site to enable testing.
